# Ubiquiti Employee Devices Application


This application has been designed and developed keeping Ubiquiti's employees in mind. The app helps the employees to easily and effortlessly search, filter, share and inspect one of Ubiquiti's many devices.

## Technologies used


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].  I also used Typescript, as per Ubiquiti's request and jest for running a few tests.

## Challenges?

Deploying to github pages was a bit tricky, based on how my project was setup and that this was a React project.  But from frustration comes learning.

## What is next??

More tests can be added to check all use cases.
Refinement on the ease of use after feedback from the employees.
Performance of the app can be looked at to limit response time.

## How to run the project?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance and then deploys to my master branch in Github.


And that is a wrap for this project. Here is to growing and learning more with every line of code.

Thanks
